      My uncle has got to be one of the best cooks that I know. When we have a
      family get together, this dish is often requested.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups pineapple juice</li>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the pineapple juice, soy sauce, ginger,
        garlic powder, and white pepper. Reserve a small amount of the marinade
        separately for dipping later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in marinade, and add enough water to cover. Cover, and
        refrigerate for 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Heat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Brush grate lightly with oil. Grill chicken 5 to 7 minutes per side,
        depending on thickness. Chicken is done when inside is no longer pink
        and juices run clear.
      </li>
    </ol>
